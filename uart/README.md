1. **Module and Parameters**:
   - We're creating a unit called `uart`.
   - It can have settings like how fast it talks (`BAUD_RATE`).

2. **Input and Output Ports**:
   - It listens to the clock (`clk`), a signal called `uart_rx`, and a button named `btn1`.
   - It talks back through a signal called `uart_tx` and controls some LEDs.

3. **Initialization and Constants**:
   - We prepare some memory to store received data and set some starting values.
   - We decide what different states the receiving process can be in, like "waiting for data" or "reading data".

4. **Receiving Data**:
   - We watch for changes in the `uart_rx` signal and keep track of time.
   - Depending on what's happening, we switch between different tasks like "reading a start bit" or "waiting for the next bit".

5. **LED Control**:
   - When we've received a full byte of data, we light up some LEDs to show what we got.

6. **Initialization and Constants for Transmission**:
   - We set up memory to hold the message we want to send and set some initial values for sending data.
   - We decide what different states the sending process can be in, like "waiting to start" or "sending data".

7. **Sending Data**:
   - Similar to receiving, we keep an eye on time and change what we're doing based on that.
   - We go through the process of sending out each bit of our message.

8. **Output Assignment**:
   - Finally, we decide what to send out through `uart_tx` based on our current state.
