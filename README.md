# FPGA
This repository contains Verilog/C examples with Tang Nano (4K/9K/20K) and Zybo Z7 

## fpga_project 
This directory contains several simple implementations for Tang Nano 9K. 

- blinky (original tutorial: https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/tang/Tang-Nano-4K/examples/led.html) 
- simple functions with Verilog
- pseudo randomness with LSFR
- pseudo random with state
- calculation that takes random input and defines a LED
- An attempt to implement Travelling Salesman Problem with Verilog
